# mnml

mnml is a theme for [deck.js][deck], a JavaScript library for building modern HTML presentations. It based on the CSS of one of the default themes, called "Swiss". It has a clean look with a tad of class. A demo is available [here](http://duijf.github.io/mnml).

## Usage

1. Download the repository either as an archive or via git.

2. Copy `mnml.css` to your CSS folder and add it as a stylesheet to your [deck.js][deck] presentation:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/mnml.css" />
```

All done! Edit your slides and fire up a browser for some lovely storytelling.
