# mnml

mnml is a theme for [deck.js][deck], a JavaScript library for building modern HTML presentations. It based on the CSS of one of the default themes, called "Swiss". It has a clean, monochrome look. A demo will also be available shortly.

## Usage

1. Download the repository either as an archive or via git.

2. Copy `mnml.css` to your CSS folder and add it as a stylesheet to your [deck.js][deck] presentation:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/mnml.css" />
```

That's it! Fire up a browser and give a presentation for *acutal* profit!
