## Usage

1. Download the repository either as an archive or via git.

2. Copy `mnml.css` to your CSS folder and add it as a stylesheet to your [deck.js][deck] presentation:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/mnml.css" />
```

All done! Edit your slides and fire up a browser for some lovely storytelling.
